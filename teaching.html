    <h2>Power System Operation Analysis</h2>
    <p>Dr. Geng is offering the course of Power System Operation Analysis in Fall 2018. This course is offered in English (incl. lectures, assignments and projects) to graduate students with the research focus on power systems, at College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University. </p>
    <p>All international students in the program of electrical engineering are encouraged to take this course to fulfill graduate degree credit requirement. Domestic students are also welcome, since this course is expected to be replacable to the course with the same name but given in Chinese.</p>

<ul>
<li>Semester: Fall 2018</li>
<li>Audience: Both international and domestic graduate students</li>
<li>Language: English</li>
<li>Credit:   2.0</li>

</br>

<h2>Senior Design</h2>
    <p>Dr. Geng offers multiple senior design positions in his research group for fourth-year undergraduate students. The areas and typical topics (all with background in electrical engineering) include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>High performance computing</strong>: design an efficient solver for power system computation on multi-core CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs (and their clusters).</li>
	<li><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong>: develop an real-time inference system to predict if a power system is stable or not after large disturbances.</li>
	<li><strong>Advanced sensing technique</strong>: build a non-invasive voltage/current sensor that is able to detect voltage/current on a conductor without touching the metal.</li>
	<li><strong>Flexible wireless communication</strong>: create a wireless data relay, gateway and server to gather remote sensing data in the scenario of smart building/factory.</li>
</ul>
</br>
    <p>For the students enrolled in the senior design, office and lab space will be provided. You will take advantage of the facility at <a href="http://powerhpc.net">our lab</a>. Necessary reimbursement for research material expense will be offered.</p>
    <p>Feel free to contact Dr. Geng if you have interest in any topics above.</p>
