<p>After a short visit to Iowa State, I will attend IEEE PES General Meeting at Gaylord National Resort &amp; Convention Center, National Harbor, Washington DC. I will be at "Micro-Grids &amp; Power System Dynamics" session with my colleague <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xplipower/home" target="_blank">Xingpeng Li</a>, who will be presenting our co-authored paper at 2pm, July 31.</p>
